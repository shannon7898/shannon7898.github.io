      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a creative, and insightful individual with a thirst for knowledge and experience. 
        I look at every challenge that comes my way as a learning experience, an opportunity to gain knowledge and sharpen my skills and talents. 
        If there is one thing in life I strive to do is to become a better version of myself and to use what I have to benefit other people. 
        I want to inspire people to reach for their dreams.</p>
